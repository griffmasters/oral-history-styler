# oral-history-styler
A small tool for processing CSV output from transcription software into something closer to meeting Smithsonian oral history transcription guidelines

This script takes a CSV file generated by Adobe Premier Pro subtitle export and cleanes it up to more closely resemble the format defined in https://www.aaa.si.edu/oral-history-program-style-guide-section-1-formatting.
