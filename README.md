# oral-history-styler
A small tool for processing CSV output from transcription software into something closer to meeting Smithsonian oral history transcription guidelines

This script takes a CSV file generated by Adobe Premier Pro subtitle export and cleanes it up to more closely resemble the format defined in https://www.aaa.si.edu/oral-history-program-style-guide-section-1-formatting. 

# testing

Any meaningful parsing and formatting logic is contained in transcribe.py.  Everything outside of the text-handling only relates to making this run as a windowed app using tkinter.

The transcribe module can be run directly from the command line for testing with the path to a csv file as an argument.  Some examples of csv files are included in /tests that align with the generated files that this should be able to handle, including some bad lines to excersize some basic error handling.
