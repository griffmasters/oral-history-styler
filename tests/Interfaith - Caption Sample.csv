"00:00:00:16","00:00:01:15","MEG MARTIN: Hi, everybody.","1"
"00:00:01:15","00:00:07:22","Welcome back to our second returning episode of Lean in Olympia.","1"
"00:00:08:06","00:00:09:19","My name is Meg Martin.","1"
"00:00:09:19","00:00:13:22","I'm the director of integrative services for interfaith Works","1"
"00:00:13:22","00:00:17:22","and one of your co-hosts of Lean in Olympia.","1"
"00:00:18:13","00:00:21:23","So as we talked about before with Corey,","1"
"00:00:21:23","00:00:27:08","my co-host last time,one of the things that I love most about Lean In Olympia","1"
"00:00:27:08","00:00:32:21","is the opportunity to highlight other amazing people in our communityand the work that they're doing.","1"
"00:00:33:10","00:00:37:23","And today, I have a special guest who I've worked with now","1"
"00:00:37:23","00:00:42:12","for a long time, very long time, probably over ten years.","1"
"00:00:42:12","00:00:43:19","At this point.","1"
"00:00:43:19","00:00:47:19","Katie Strozyk, the opioid and overdose","1"
"00:00:47:20","00:00:52:00","response program manager for Thurston County Public Health","1"
"00:00:52:17","00:00:58:16","and I'm so excited to have you here today to talk about an issuethat is very near and dear to my heart.","1"
"00:00:59:14","00:01:04:14","Overdose and overdose preventionand helping to support people in our community","1"
"00:01:04:14","00:01:09:11","who are struggling with addiction, looking to access treatment","1"
"00:01:09:11","00:01:13:19","and also just living their lives every day as people who use substances.","1"
"00:01:14:02","00:01:16:00","So, Katie, welcome.","1"
"00:01:16:00","00:01:16:21","KATIE STROZYK: Thank you so much.","1"
"00:01:16:21","00:01:17:19","MARTIN: Yeah.","1"
"00:01:17:19","00:01:24:05","Can we start just with you telling us a little bit about your officeand your position?","1"
"00:01:24:05","00:01:30:17","I think there's probably still a lot of people in the communitywho might not be aware of the work that you're doing every day.","1"
"00:01:30:23","00:01:32:00","STROZYK: Yeah, definitely.","1"
"00:01:32:00","00:01:36:09","So my position is housed at ThurstonCounty Public Health and Social Services,","1"
"00:01:36:09","00:01:42:12","and we've been really lucky to be able to expand our work in opioidand overdose response over the last few years, too.","1"
"00:01:42:13","00:01:49:10","So when I started five and a half years ago now, it was reallyjust me in the position looking at opioid and overdose response.","1"
"00:01:49:11","00:01:51:23","We've been able to develop a whole program since then.","1"
"00:01:51:23","00:02:00:11","Now, so we have multiple staff members working on everythingfrom primary prevention to specialized pregnant and parenting work.","1"
"00:02:00:17","00:02:06:07","We also have an entire drug user health program at the countythat operates a syringe services program,","1"
"00:02:06:13","00:02:10:19","hepatitis C and HIV screening, case management, things like that.","1"
"00:02:11:00","00:02:16:03","So we've been able to develop our scope and expandand really try to meet","1"
"00:02:16:03","00:02:20:03","the need of our communitymore as we've been able to bring more folks on board.","1"
"00:02:20:04","00:02:24:10","We're also in charge of moving forwardthe opioid response plan for Thurston County.","1"
"00:02:24:15","00:02:29:02","So our team does a ton of strategic planning, program planning,","1"
"00:02:29:04","00:02:33:04","finding grant funding, doing overdose education, things like that.","1"
"00:02:33:14","00:02:35:09","MARTIN: Is that opioid response plan—","1"
"00:02:35:09","00:02:41:13","Is that like something that every community has,or is that a thing that is kind of unique to Thurston County?","1"
"00:02:41:15","00:02:43:17","STROZYK: It would be great if every community had it.","1"
"00:02:43:17","00:02:48:10","We are looked at often at the statefor being highlighted as one of the communities","1"
"00:02:48:10","00:02:52:10","who does have one and who has a robust one as well.","1"
"00:02:52:18","00:02:58:17","A lot of counties and even just like jurisdiction hubsdon't have a response plan on paper.","1"
"00:02:58:18","00:03:03:03","They've got like a coordinated effort of response,but they really don't have","1"
"00:03:03:03","00:03:07:12","something on paperthat shows their goals and their strategies that they're all working on.","1"
"00:03:07:19","00:03:13:19","Ours is kind of mirrored off of the stateopioid and overdose response plan to align with that.","1"
"00:03:14:00","00:03:17:16","But to make it more localized for us here in Thurston County.","1"
"00:03:17:16","00:03:21:23","Up and down the I-5 corridor, we're really one of the only areasthat has this","1"
"00:03:21:23","00:03:26:17","robust of a response planthat's gone forward to be adopted by the Board of Health and everything.","1"
"00:03:27:03","00:03:31:09","MARTIN: Do you think that a lot of that is because of, like, your passion","1"
"00:03:31:09","00:03:37:00","and the passion of people in your officeto kind of push that sort of policy forward?","1"
"00:03:37:04","00:03:38:00","STROZYK: So I was lucky.","1"
"00:03:38:00","00:03:42:02","I came in when the first iteration of the responseplan was already developed.","1"
"00:03:42:10","00:03:48:14","But I think that especially in other jurisdictions,I've seen folks tried to kind of implement","1"
"00:03:48:14","00:03:52:14","a response plan, and then it gets on paper and it kind of dies off.","1"
"00:03:52:17","00:04:00:05","Either stakeholders don't stay invested in it or it becomes an outdateddocument on someone's hard drive that's never looked at again.","1"
"00:04:00:10","00:04:06:01","Whereas we really have been prioritizingmaking this a living document for Thurston County.","1"
"00:04:06:06","00:04:11:16","So while I was brought on right after the first iteration,we've gone through every year and revised it.","1"
"00:04:11:21","00:04:15:20","We've adopted it to include things like stimulant overdoses.","1"
"00:04:15:21","00:04:21:00","We adjusted the needs and priorities with itwhen we saw fentanyl really come into our community.","1"
"00:04:21:05","00:04:25:13","And so rather than it just being a document that we createdfive and a half years","1"
"00:04:25:13","00:04:29:17","ago, it's really been involved with more stakeholder input.","1"
"00:04:29:18","00:04:30:22","MARTIN: Yeah.","1"
"00:04:30:22","00:04:35:12","STROZYK: And— MARTIN: So it's not like people who use drugsor who are at risk of overdose.","1"
"00:04:35:12","00:04:36:00","STROZYK: Yeah.","1"
"00:04:36:00","00:04:40:11","So both we've got like our stakeholders who participate in the task","1"
"00:04:40:11","00:04:44:12","force, who are involved in it, electedofficials, the normal folks at the table.","1"
"00:04:44:17","00:04:48:19","But then we've really also prioritized looking at how the individuals","1"
"00:04:48:19","00:04:52:19","in our communitywho are using drugs can play into our response plan as well.","1"
"00:04:53:00","00:04:59:17","So looking at a lot of our overdose strategies and our treatmentstrategies, and pulling from our drug user health surveys","1"
"00:04:59:17","00:05:06:09","that we do at our Sheridan Services program, and then also lookingthrough our current revision process that we're doing for 2025,","1"
"00:05:06:10","00:05:11:12","seeing how we can involve folks with both lived and currentliving experience who are using drugs as well.","1"
"00:05:11:20","00:05:12:17","MARTIN: Oh that's awesome.","1"
"00:05:14:00","00:05:18:04","I'm sointerested about like some of the specific strategies in the plan,","1"
"00:05:18:04","00:05:24:20","but I'm wondering if we could just back up a little bitand can you just speak to sort of generally","1"
"00:05:25:05","00:05:31:00","what's happening right now in our communitywith fentanyl, with opioids, with stimulants, like what—","1"
"00:05:31:18","00:05:35:19","How is it impacting our community currently, and what are some of the","1"
"00:05:37:07","00:05:38:22","highlights that you're seeing?","1"
"00:05:38:22","00:05:44:17","STROZYK: Yeah, so I think we've seen similar things as other communities have and just the state overall in general","1"
"00:05:44:21","00:05:48:21","where we really saw our drug supply shift from heroin over to fentanyl,","1"
"00:05:48:22","00:05:53:02","and then we saw the mass amount of overdose deaths as a result.","1"
"00:05:53:02","00:05:57:18","And the tremendous amount of non-fatal overdosesthat we've seen in the last few years as well.","1"
"00:05:58:00","00:06:05:06","We really have seen with the drug supply shift,more and more folks get touched even by the overdose epidemic.","1"
"00:06:05:11","00:06:09:12","And so we're seeing a more broad stretchacross our community at this point.","1"
"00:06:09:12","00:06:16:12","We've really seemed, to move to exclusively having fentanylbe the opioid supply right now.","1"
"00:06:16:16","00:06:21:11","And also we've seen a huge shift in like injectionand smoking behaviors as well,","1"
"00:06:21:17","00:06:25:17","which of— it's caused us to totally have to change our approach.","1"
"00:06:25:17","00:06:26:20","We knew how to interact—","1"
"00:06:26:20","00:06:29:06","MARTIN: People are injecting less and— STROZYK: Yeah.","1"
"00:06:29:06","00:06:30:13","MARTIN: Smoking more.","1"
"00:06:30:13","00:06:33:20","STROZYK: Yeah. Historically,we knew how to interact with folks who were injecting.","1"
"00:06:33:20","00:06:35:17","We had evidence based practices.","1"
"00:06:35:17","00:06:39:12","We knew how to control, disease spread through injection.","1"
"00:06:39:12","00:06:45:07","And so having a large chunk of our drugusing population be smoking, exclusively","1"
"00:06:45:07","00:06:50:05","or as their main route, has been totally new to us in public health.","1"
"00:06:50:12","00:06:51:01","MARTIN: Yeah.","1"
"00:06:52:04","00:06:52:20","So are","1"
"00:06:52:20","00:06:57:15","overdose deaths in our community is still on the rise.","1"
"00:06:57:15","00:07:03:10","Are we kind of still seeing like thislike up up up up up up up, of fentanyl or has it.","1"
"00:07:04:09","00:07:06:23","Where are things out with those trends right now. STROZYK: Yeah.","1"
"00:07:06:23","00:07:09:02","So our numbers are still preliminary.","1"
"00:07:09:02","00:07:13:02","It can take months to sometimes a year for our numbers to be final.","1"
"00:07:13:02","00:07:16:03","But it looks like we're going to start to see a decrease pretty soon.","1"
"00:07:16:03","00:07:20:12","We at least, over the last year have kind of seen a leveling off happen","1"
"00:07:20:19","00:07:25:20","where we're not seeing that huge 2 to 3 timejump in overdose deaths anymore.","1"
"00:07:26:02","00:07:30:05","The one thing that we do continue to see, though,is non-fatal overdoses.","1"
"00:07:30:09","00:07:36:19","So just because we're not seeing those overdose numbers skyrocket,we do still see a ton of overdoses in our community.","1"
"00:07:37:02","00:07:38:10","MARTIN: Yeah, yeah.","1"
"00:07:40:04","00:07:43:14","How does stimulants and stimulant use","1"
"00:07:43:14","00:07:48:06","like methamphetamine or cocaine or other stimulants?","1"
"00:07:49:03","00:07:54:09","Like how does that interact with fentanylor with the overdose crisis in general?","1"
"00:07:54:18","00:08:01:10","STROZYK: Yeah, I think that one of the things that we see that's not often talked about is just the number of folks who are overdosing on stimulants.","1"
"00:08:01:17","00:08:05:21","So who are using too much methand having a meth related overdose as a result?","1"
"00:08:05:21","00:08:11:19","I think there's really this misconceptionthat you can't overdose on stimulants because it looks different.","1"
"00:08:12:04","00:08:19:22","With, with opioids, and with fentanyl, we see folks use and thenoverdose and it's kind of like you see this and then this happens.","1"
"00:08:19:22","00:08:22:16","And here's how you respond. And there just isn't that.","1"
"00:08:22:16","00:08:28:23","So we see folks who use too much meth, and then they goto the emergency room because their heart was doing something weird.","1"
"00:08:29:19","00:08:31:06","Or they had a stroke.","1"
"00:08:31:06","00:08:33:16","And that still counts as a stimulant overdose.","1"
"00:08:33:16","00:08:37:22","And it's just not really capturedthe same way that we capture opioid overdoses.","1"
"00:08:38:03","00:08:45:15","So not a lot of conversations about that, even though it is becomingincreasingly more prevalent both locally and at the state level.","1"
"00:08:45:21","00:08:49:12","To see stimulant overdoses. MARTIN: Yeah.","1"
"00:08:49:12","00:08:50:21","Yeah. Yeah.","1"
"00:08:50:21","00:08:55:15","Like with opioid overdose, it's very it's like respiratory depression,","1"
"00:08:55:21","00:08:59:21","which can then lead to cardiac arrest,which then leads can lead to death.","1"
"00:08:59:21","00:09:02:18","And so then it's very like you can see it.","1"
"00:09:02:18","00:09:11:03","And so I feel like there's also a lot of probably community educationaround stimulant use and what it does and what overdose looks like.","1"
"00:09:11:03","00:09:16:12","That again, to your point of the likeinjecting versus smoking, public health","1"
"00:09:18:07","00:09:20:05","like I could","1"
"00:09:20:05","00:09:24:17","just see that that would be a real shift in the way that we're messaging","1"
"00:09:24:17","00:09:30:00","or that we're educating or even buildingcommunity awareness around the issue.","1"
"00:09:30:02","00:09:34:20","STROZYK: Yeah, it's hard to talk about stimulant overdoses, too,because with opioid overdoses,","1"
"00:09:34:20","00:09:38:06","like there's a tool you give folks naloxoneand you teach them how to use it.","1"
"00:09:38:06","00:09:42:03","And then as a bystander, you know what to do with stigma and overdoses.","1"
"00:09:42:03","00:09:44:05","There isn't that like magic answer.","1"
"00:09:44:05","00:09:48:15","Like when someone injects too much meth,they need emergency medical attention.","1"
"00:09:48:15","00:09:50:04","They need to go to a hospital.","1"
"00:09:50:04","00:09:53:13","They need other interventions that just bystanders can't provide.","1"
"00:09:53:13","00:09:55:15","So it gets a little bit more complicated.","1"
"00:09:55:15","00:09:58:17","And I think that as we start to talk about it, folks kind of feel lost.","1"
"00:09:58:17","00:10:04:04","Because it's hard to identify,because someone isn't just unresponsive and—","1"
